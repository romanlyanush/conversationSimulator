Ladies and gentleman, let me introduce to you a program that simulates a conversation with a three-year-old. You already know how it goes.
Children have an infinite amount of questions and no matter what answer you give them, they always gonna ask “Why?”.
And the only way to stop them is to say “just because”. Trust me, they seem quite happy with this kind of response!

Disclaimer: the answer “just because” is acceptable kind of language while communicating with MY program. Your kids are KIDS after all, and they
deserve better even if your very own parents treated you like sh!t.

I hope everybody is having a great time because I am. Go while loops!
